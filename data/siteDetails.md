    This site was developed mostly with the help of streamlit, I have also used some HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

    <p style="font-size: 150%; color: royalblue"> Why</p>
    Since my first year
    at Ben Gurion University Ive been working around the clock, mostly as private teacher, to make a living and provide myself.
    I have started to look for my first job opportunity around the end of my third year, I am looking for a position
    that will provide me the option to learn, combining good atmosphere.
